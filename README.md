## Prompt 1: The Email Makeover

```
Rewrite this email to politely decline the committee invitation. Make it:

- Warm and professional 
- Brief (3-4 sentences maximum) 
- Clear about saying "no" without over-explaining 
- Offer to help in a different way 

Here's the email:

Subject: RE: Volunteer Opportunity - New Membership Committee

Hi Jennifer,

Thanks so much for thinking of me for the membership committee. I really 
appreciate that you thought I'd be a good fit and I'm honestly flattered 
that you reached out. The work you're doing with membership is really 
important and I know the committee has accomplished a lot this year.

I have to be honest though - I'm really struggling right now with my 
workload. I'm already on the Events Committee (which has been taking up 
way more time than I expected, especially with the conference coming up 
in March), and I also got pulled into the Website Redesign Task Force 
back in October, which they said would only be a few hours a month but 
it's turned into basically a part-time job. On top of that, my actual 
job has gotten really busy because we're short-staffed after Lisa left, 
and I'm covering some of her accounts until they hire someone new, which 
who knows when that will be.

I'm also trying to be better about work-life balance this year because 
last year I basically burned out in November and it wasn't great. My 
family has been really patient but I've missed a lot of stuff and I'm 
trying to be more present at home.

So unfortunately I don't think I can take on another committee right now. 
I wish I could because like I said, the work is really important, but I 
just don't think I'd be able to give it the attention it deserves and I'd 
hate to commit and then not be able to follow through. That wouldn't be 
fair to you or the rest of the committee.

Maybe next year when things calm down? Or if there's something smaller I 
could help with that doesn't require coming to all the meetings, let me 
know. I'd be happy to help in some other way if there's something that 
makes sense.

Again, thanks for thinking of me!

Best,
Clair

## Prompt 1a: 

Instead of wasting time writing the above long email and letting GenAI rewrite it, let GenAI write it from the start:

```
I need to write an email declining a committee invitation. Here's the situation:

- Jennifer asked me to join a new Membership Committee for our professional association
- I need to say no because I'm already on 2 other committees and my job is busy
- I want to sound warm and professional, not rude or lazy
- I'd like to offer to help in some other smaller way if possible

Please draft a brief, polite email (3-4 sentences) that declines gracefully.
```

## Prompt 2: The Email Thread Monster

```
I'm preparing a status update for my boss who has a board meeting Monday. She needs to know the status of Project X, which is supposed to launch by end of February.

Please review this email thread and summarize:

1. Are we on track, ahead, or behind schedule? What's the current launch date?
2. What's the budget status? Are we over or under?
3. Are there any current blockers or issues that need attention?
4. Overall project health - is everything ready?

Please provide a brief summary with 3-5 key bullet points.

## Prompt 3: "Can I get that by the end of the day?"

```
I work for a commercial kitchen equipment distributor based in Denver serving restaurants, hotels, and ski resorts across Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming (the Mountain West region). Our VP needs to brief the board Thursday on the health of the restaurant and hospitality sector in our market.

Please review this Federal Reserve Beige Book and summarize:
1. What's happening with consumer spending at restaurants in the Mountain West/Western regions?
2. Are there differences between high-end dining vs. casual/quick-service restaurants?
3. Any regional factors (weather, tourism, consumer behavior) affecting restaurant demand?
4. What's the outlook - should we expect restaurants to be investing in equipment or holding back?

Keep it focused on actionable insights for our sales and inventory planning.

Here is the Beige Book:
